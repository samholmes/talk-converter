## Setup

1. **Prerequisites**

   - Node.js (v16 or higher)
   - ffmpeg (required for video processing)
   - AWS Account (for transcription services)
   - Anthropic API Key (for AI-powered summaries)

2. **Installation**

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd talk-converter

   # Install dependencies
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**
   Copy the `.env.template` file to `.env` and fill in the values:

   ```
   # Anthropic API Key for generating summaries and articles
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key

   # AWS Credentials
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1              # The AWS region for your services
   AWS_S3_BUCKET=your_s3_bucket_name # The S3 bucket for storing audio files and transcripts
   ```

   Make sure your AWS credentials are set up correctly with the following permissions:

   - AmazonS3FullAccess
   - AmazonTranscribeFullAccess

   The S3 bucket should be created in your AWS account and accessible with your credentials.

## How to Use

1. **Basic Usage**

   Make sure you create 2 folders in the proejct directory.
   __talks for talk files
   __youtube for youtube source videos .mp4

   Use either Youtube Creator studio or the youtube-dl CLI tool download the .mp4 720p minumum video you desire (DEVx stream in this case) and renmae the download to be the {YouTube Video ID}.mp4 ie: youtube.com/watch?v=2cMzN_4guQ0 becomes 2cMzN_4guQ0.mp4

   Then watch the video through and update the run.sh bash script with a single line for each talk you'd like to process. Script is run once per individual talk to be sliced.

   - `YouTube URL`: Full URL of the YouTube video
   - `timestamps`: Format "start,end" in seconds or HH:MM:SS format
   - `title`: Title for the extracted talk segment

3. **Example**

   ```bash
   npm start -- "https://youtube.com/watch?v=example" "00:15:30,01:45:20" "Understanding AI Systems"
   ```

4. **Output**
   The tool will create:

   - A video file of the extracted segment (`__talks/[title].mp4`)
   - An audio transcript (`__talks/[title].txt`)
   - A markdown file with AI-generated description and article (`__talks/[title].md`)

5. **Processing Steps**
   - Downloads the full YouTube video
   - Extracts the specified segment
   - Generates transcript using AWS Transcribe
   - Creates AI-powered summary and article using Claude

## Notes

- The tool caches downloaded videos and generated transcripts to avoid reprocessing
- Make sure you have sufficient AWS permissions for S3 and Transcribe services
- Video segments are saved in the `__talks` directory
- Original downloaded videos are stored in the `__youtube` directory
- The tool originally was supposed to download the YouTube video for you via code, but I was unable to make that work with the given time constraints
